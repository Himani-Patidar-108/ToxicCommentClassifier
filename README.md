# ToxicCommentClassifier
Detection of abusive language in online text, where abusive language is deﬁned as using, containing, coarsely insulting language. I have observed that it is typically characterized by the use of a small set of high frequency stereotypical words making our task similar to that of text classiﬁcation. More speciﬁcally I address detecting abusive language into six ﬁner categories namely toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate. Naive Bayes is used for classification.
